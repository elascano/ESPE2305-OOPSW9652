•	When we discuss managing the connection with a MongoDB database, adhering to the single responsibility principle is essential for maintaining clean and efficient code. By assigning the single responsibility of managing the database connection to a specific module or class, we enhance the overall maintainability and modularity of our application.
•	Isolating the responsibility of handling the MongoDB connection enables us to create a dedicated module that deals exclusively with establishing, maintaining, and closing connections. This encapsulation not only simplifies the codebase but also promotes reusability. With a clearly defined module for connection management, other parts of the application can interact with the database without concerning themselves with connection-related intricacies.
•	The method addBudget() encapsulates an interesting balance between the open/closed principle in software design. By being open for extension and closed for modification, this method exemplifies a key principle in object-oriented programming. The fact that it can be used in various parts of the codebase without requiring modifications showcases its extensibility.
•	The open/closed principle suggests that existing code should remain untouched while allowing for new functionality to be added through extensions. In the case of addBudget(), its design adheres to this principle by enabling its reuse without necessitating changes. This not only preserves the stability of the existing code but also promotes a modular and adaptable approach to development.

The component's primary focus on managing and displaying help text underscores its alignment with the single responsibility principle. This deliberate design choice contributes to a codebase that is more modular, comprehensible, and adaptable, ultimately facilitating smoother development and maintenance processes.
